1. LZA requires access to its source code files in GitHub.  It will check these when the pipeline initiates. Do you want to 
allow this access or setup replication?
2. What email address are you going to use to receive alerts for manual approval of the LZA pipeline?
3. Tags, should we discuss the importance of tagging?  Yes.  I like to start out with a simple 'created_manually' key.
4. HOw do you want to organize the OU structure?
